# LPC31xx

This repo contains LPC3131 / LPC3141 / LPC3143 stuff.

It includes (some) of these...


	1.) Bootloader patches for:
		1.1.) APEX Bootloader v1.6.8
		1.2.) U-Boot Bootloader v1.3.4
		1.3.) Linux Kernel v2.6.29

The patches included here are either official patches by:

	- EA (Embedded Artists)
	- NXP

The reason this repository exists is that patch files and CDL* drivers
either...:

	1.) ...got lost...
	2.) ...were updated without any trace back of the changes...

...throughout all the years when development on either of the MCU's
mentioned, started.

Hopefully this will help others who still have devkits laying around
or even code repos which are missing any of this.
